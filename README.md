# Fun game for two
This is my first C++ program.

I am making a game board which has a 3x3 charcter grid interface for both users (along with a counter to track filled cells).

This game is developed using a 3x3 grid in the console interface.
This game is for 2 players.
Each player gets one turn each and cannot overwrite another players previous choice.
The first person to fill all cells wins OR ends in a draw if all spaces are filled without one player getting 3 cells in a row.

NOTE** this was used merely to be used for me to learn the syntax and understand how to program with C++
