# Fun game for two
This is my first C++ program.

I am making a game board which has a 3x3 charcter grid interface for both users (along with a counter to track filled cells).

I have sued methods drawBoard() to show what the board currently looks like at every turn.
isValidMove() is checking if the move that the user does is valid.
makeMove() updates the board with the current player's new move.
